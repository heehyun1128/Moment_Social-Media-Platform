With an epiphany, grandma braised the overripe golden pineapples into preservable homemade jam. ‚ÄãTheir most sought-out drink, Yifang Fruit Tea, inherited not only grandma‚Äôs name, but also her secret recipe. They have put the early Taiwan epitome, historic memories and warm hospitality in this one cup of drink ‚Äî using home-made organic cane sugar, seasonal fresh fruits, and natural ingredients (zero concentrated juice and powders). In every sip, you can taste the freshness of the tea and sweetness of the fruits, recreating the authentic and classic Taiwanese flavor all over again.",
